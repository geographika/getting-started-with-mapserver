# Docker

We will be using MapServer on a Docker image for the workshop. This ensures that the MapServer version and the Apache web server configuration are identical.

## Docker MapServer

A custom MapServer Docker image has been created for the workshop, and the Dockerfile is found [here](https://github.com/MapServer/getting-started-with-mapserver/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile). 

MapServer runs on the Apache web server - see the [Apache page](../advanced/apache.md) page for further details. 

It uses the Apache [mod_fcgid module](https://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/), module that provides FastCGI support.

MapServer runs on port `8080` on the Docker container, which is mapped to port `7000` on the local machine, as can be seen in the Docker compose file
located at `workshop\exercises\docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
  mapserver:
    image: geographika/mapserver-workshop:latest
    container_name: mapserver
    ports:
      - 7000:8080
    environment:
      MAPSERVER_CONFIG_FILE: "/etc/mapserver/mapserver.conf"
    volumes:
      - ./scripts:/scripts
      - ./mapfiles:/etc/mapserver
    networks:
      - mynetwork
```

## JavaScript Application

A second container that serves the JavaScript example pages is also run using Docker. This uses Node and runs on port 7001 on both the container and the host machine.

```yaml
  node:
    image: node:lts-slim
    container_name: node
    ports:
      - 7001:7001
    working_dir: /home/node/app
    volumes:
      - ./app:/home/node/app
    networks:
      - mynetwork
    command: >
      sh -c "npm install && npm start"
```

## Stopping and Starting Docker

```bash

  cd ./getting-started-with-mapserver/workshop/exercises
  # start docker in detached mode
  docker compose up -d
  # the following URLs should now be available
  # http://localhost:7000
  # http://localhost:7001

  # stop docker
  docker compose down

  # for help
  docker compose help
  # for a specific command
  docker compose up --help
```


## Removing a Container

```bash
# to remove a container named db
docker rm db
```
